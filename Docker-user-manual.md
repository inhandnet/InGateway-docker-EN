# InGateway902 Docker user manual
InGateway902 series edge computing gateway (IG902 for short) supports manage docker images. You can publish your docker images to IG902 to quickly deploy and run applications developed by yourself. In order to introduce how to use IG902's Docker environment, this document will demonstrate how to run an Nginx image on IG902. This image is used for open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP protocols, and load balancer, HTTP cache And web server.  <br/>
Docker is an open source application container engine that allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a portable container and then publish it to any popular Linux machine or Windows machine. It can also be virtualized. The container is completely with the sandbox mechanism, there will be no interface between each other.

## 2. Enable and configure Docker manager

<a id="install-docker-sdk-and-enable-docker-manager"> </a>  

### 2.1 Install Docker SDK and enable Docker manager
The Docker SDK integrates the operating environment and docker image manager required to run the docker image. Before using Docker, you must install the Docker SDK. To obtain the Docker SDK, please contact the customer service center.  </br>
- Step 1: If you already have the Docker SDK, choose Edge Computing > Docker Manager page of IG902, close the Docker Manager and import the Docker SDK.  

  ![](images/2020-02-12-17-27-06.png)  

- Step 2: After importing, IG902 will automatically install the Docker SDK. The installation process usually takes 1-2 minutes. Please be patient. After successful installation, select Enable Docker Manager and click Submit.  

  ![](images/2020-02-11-15-19-42.png)  
   
- Step 3: Then you can modify the port number and login password to access the Docker manager.

### 2.2 Configure Docker Manager--Portainer
IG902 uses Portainer to build, manage and maintain Docker images and containers. For a detailed introduction and instructions on Portainer, please see the [Portainer official website](https://www.portainer.io/overview/). This document will show you how to add and deploy an Nginx docker image on IG902.

#### 2.2.2 Add docker image
There are two ways to add docker images for Portainerï¼š
- Method 1: Import the local docker image from the Edge Computing > Docker Manager page of IG902. (The time required for import varies depending on the size of the docker image; please be patient when the docker image is large.)  

  ![](images/2020-02-11-15-29-07.png)  
   
  You can see the docker image successfully imported on the Local > Images page of Portainer.  

  ![](images/2020-01-14-17-24-07.png)  
   
- Method 2: Choose Local > Images page of Portainer and download the nginx docker image from DockerHub. (The time required to download the image varies depending on the size of the image; please be patient when the docker image is large)  

  ![](images/2020-01-21-15-24-52.png)  
   
  After the docker image is downloaded, you can see the corresponding docker image information in Local > Images as shown below:

  ![](images/2020-01-13-18-16-28.png)  
   
- Step 4: After entering the Nginx access link (IP address + port number of IG902) configured in the container in the browser, you can see the Nginx welcome page.This shows that the Nginx docker image has been running on the IG902 normally. Now, you have completed adding and deploying an Nginx docker image on the IG902.
